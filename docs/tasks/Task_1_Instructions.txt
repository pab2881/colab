Task 1: Rewrite enhanced_backend.py
Claude Assistant 1:
Objective: Create a unified FastAPI backend integrating Betfair and Smarkets with 5-minute synchronized fetching.
Existing Code: enhanced_backend.py (and reference server.cjs for Betfair auth logic).
Requirements:
Use BetfairAPI and SmarketsAPI classes for fetching.
Fetch British football markets (list provided) every 5 minutes using schedule.
Log markets and odds to data/markets_<timestamp>.json.
Detect lag between Betfair and Smarkets fetches; if >1s, offset Smarkets fetch by the lag amount using async tasks.
Include endpoints: /health, /api/live-markets, /api/odds/{platform}/{market_id}.
Output: Updated enhanced_backend.py.
Verification: Iâ€™ll check for correct scheduling, logging, and lag handling; ChatGPT will confirm syntax and logic.
