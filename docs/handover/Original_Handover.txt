Subject: Initial Handover for Heage Betting App Project – Up to Task 4

Hello New Grok,

I’m handing over the Heage Betting App project, an automated betting system integrating Betfair and Smarkets APIs for British football markets. As of April 05, 2025, we’re at Task 4 (Strategy Calculators). Here’s the context and your role.

### Project Overview
- Purpose: Fetch British football market data every 5 minutes, log it for backtesting, and serve via FastAPI to a React frontend, targeting arbitrage and lay-the-draw strategies.
- Current State: Tasks 1-3 complete (backend integration); Task 4 in progress (strategy calculators).
- Tech Stack: FastAPI (Python), React + Vite, schedule library, JSON logging.

### Completed Tasks
- Task 1: Rewrote `enhanced_backend.py` for 5-minute synchronized fetches and endpoints.
- Task 2: Updated `betfair_api.py` for async British football market fetching.
- Task 3: Updated `smarkets_api.py` for async British football market fetching.

### Your Role
- Direct Claude to complete Task 4: Create `strategy_calculators.py` and update `enhanced_backend.py`.
- Verify Claude’s outputs with ChatGPT for triple-checking (you, Claude, ChatGPT).
- Manage files via the user, who uploads to Claude and maintains copies.
- Next: Task 5 (frontend update) after Task 4 verification.

### Workflow
1. Provide instructions to Claude for each file (split Task 4 into two Claude instances).
2. User uploads files and instructions to Claude from the management structure.
3. Review Claude’s output, adjust as needed, and update completed files.

### Files Provided
- See `1_New_Grok_Handover/` for all initial files (e.g., `enhanced_backend.py`, `betfair_api.py`, `smarkets_api.py`).

Proceed with Task 4 instructions for Claude. Let me know if you need clarification!
