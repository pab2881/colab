Subject: Handover for Heage Betting App Project – Task 4 Complete, Ready for Task 5 and Expansion

Hello New Grok,

I’m the Original Grok, handing over the Heage Betting App project to you, an automated betting system integrating Betfair and Smarkets APIs for British football markets. As of April 05, 2025, we’ve completed Task 4 (Strategy Calculators), and I’ve conducted research to expand the project to include all football bet types. Below is everything you need to know to take over the project.

### Initial Instructions and Rules
Attached as "Initial_Instructions.txt" (updated):
- Defines your role as Grok 3 built by xAI, with tools like X profile analysis, content analysis, web/X search, and image generation (ask for confirmation first, edit only your own images).
- Guidelines: Current date is April 05, 2025; no knowledge cutoff; don’t decide who spreads misinformation; don’t judge who deserves the death penalty (say AI can’t make that choice).
- Use these tools/rules only when explicitly asked, and don’t mention them otherwise unless requested.
- You’re the new Grok taking over after Task 4, overseeing development, verifying Claude’s outputs, and coordinating with ChatGPT for triple-checking, as of Task 5 (Frontend Update) and the expansion of `strategy_calculators.py`.

### Research: All Football Bet Types
Below is a compiled request explaining all known football bet types and how to integrate them into the project, based on my research and input from ChatGPT and Claude.

**Objective:** Expand `strategy_calculators.py` to include methods for calculating profitable opportunities for all known football bet types using back and lay odds from Betfair and Smarkets APIs.

**Bet Types and Mechanics:**

1. **1X2 (Match Result):** Predict the match outcome (Home, Draw, Away).
   - **Mechanics:** Predict the final result. Odds are provided for each outcome (e.g., Home: 2.0, Draw: 3.5, Away: 3.8).
   - **Integration:** Method `calculate_1x2(back_odds_1, lay_odds_1, back_odds_x, lay_odds_x, back_odds_2, lay_odds_2, stake)` to hedge across all three outcomes.

2. **Over/Under Goals:** Total goals over/under a threshold (e.g., 2.5).
   - **Mechanics:** Over 2.5 means 3+ goals; Under 2.5 means 0-2 goals. Odds for each (e.g., Over: 1.9, Under: 1.95).
   - **Integration:** Method `calculate_over_under(back_over_odds, lay_over_odds, back_under_odds, lay_under_odds, stake)` to hedge over/under outcomes.

3. **Both Teams to Score (BTTS):** Both teams score (Yes/No).
   - **Mechanics:** Two outcomes—Yes (both score) or No (at least one doesn’t). Odds (e.g., Yes: 1.8, No: 2.0).
   - **Integration:** Method `calculate_btts(back_yes_odds, lay_yes_odds, back_no_odds, lay_no_odds, stake)` to hedge Yes/No outcomes.

4. **Double Chance:** Two of three outcomes (1X, X2, 12).
   - **Mechanics:** Lower risk, lower odds (e.g., 1X: 1.3, X2: 1.5).
   - **Integration:** Method `calculate_double_chance(back_1x_odds, lay_1x_odds, back_x2_odds, lay_x2_odds, back_12_odds, lay_12_odds, stake)` to hedge across outcomes.

5. **Correct Score:** Exact final score.
   - **Mechanics:** High odds due to multiple outcomes (e.g., 1-0: 8.0, 2-1: 10.0).
   - **Integration:** Method `calculate_correct_score(scores_odds_dict, stake)` to hedge across multiple scores.

6. **Half-Time/Full-Time (HT/FT):** Result at half-time and full-time.
   - **Mechanics:** Nine outcomes (e.g., Home/Home: 3.0, Draw/Draw: 5.0).
   - **Integration:** Method `calculate_ht_ft(ht_ft_odds_dict, stake)` to hedge across nine outcomes.

7. **Asian Handicap:** Goal handicap betting.
   - **Mechanics:** Adjusts the score by the handicap (e.g., Team A must win by 2+ goals).
   - **Integration:** Method `calculate_asian_handicap(back_odds, lay_odds, handicap, stake)` to hedge adjusted outcomes.

8. **Draw No Bet (DNB):** Win with refund on draw.
   - **Mechanics:** Two outcomes (e.g., Home: 1.5, Away: 2.5; draw refunds stake).
   - **Integration:** Method `calculate_dnb(back_odds, lay_odds, draw_odds, stake)` to hedge with draw lay.

9. **First/Anytime Goalscorer:** Player to score first or anytime.
   - **Mechanics:** Player-specific odds (e.g., Player A First Goal: 5.0, Anytime: 2.0).
   - **Integration:** Method `calculate_goalscorer(back_odds, lay_odds, stake)` to hedge Yes/No outcomes.

10. **Total Corners:** Over/under number of corners.
    - **Mechanics:** Similar to over/under goals (e.g., Over 10.5: 1.9, Under 10.5: 1.9).
    - **Integration:** Method `calculate_total_corners(back_over_odds, lay_over_odds, back_under_odds, lay_under_odds, stake)` to hedge over/under outcomes.

11. **Total Cards:** Over/under number of cards.
    - **Mechanics:** Similar to over/under (e.g., Over 3.5: 2.0, Under 3.5: 1.8).
    - **Integration:** Method `calculate_total_cards(back_over_odds, lay_over_odds, back_under_odds, lay_under_odds, stake)` to hedge over/under outcomes.

12. **Player Props:** Player-specific events (e.g., shots, assists).
    - **Mechanics:** Yes/No outcomes (e.g., Player A 1+ Shot on Target: 1.5).
    - **Integration:** Method `calculate_player_prop(back_odds, lay_odds, stake)` to hedge Yes/No outcomes.

13. **Win Either Half:** Team wins at least one half.
    - **Mechanics:** Two outcomes (e.g., Home Wins Either Half: 1.7, Away: 2.0).
    - **Integration:** Method `calculate_win_either_half(back_odds, lay_odds, stake)` to hedge Yes/No outcomes.

14. **Clean Sheet:** Team doesn’t concede goals.
    - **Mechanics:** Yes/No outcome (e.g., Team A Clean Sheet: 3.0, No: 1.4).
    - **Integration:** Method `calculate_clean_sheet(back_odds, lay_odds, stake)` to hedge Yes/No outcomes.

15. **Time of First Goal:** Time bracket of first goal.
    - **Mechanics:** Multiple outcomes (e.g., 0-15 min: 3.5, 16-30 min: 4.0).
    - **Integration:** Method `calculate_time_first_goal(time_odds_dict, stake)` to hedge across time brackets.

16. **Outright Bets:** Tournament winner.
    - **Mechanics:** Long-term bet (e.g., Team A to win: 5.0).
    - **Integration:** Method `calculate_outright(back_odds, lay_odds, stake)` to hedge long-term bets.

17. **Match Specials:** Combined outcomes (e.g., Team A to win & over 2.5 goals).
    - **Mechanics:** Combined odds (e.g., Team A & Over 2.5: 4.0).
    - **Integration:** Method `calculate_match_special(back_odds, lay_odds, stake)` to hedge combined outcomes.

18. **Goal Range:** Total goals in a range (e.g., 0-1, 2-3).
    - **Mechanics:** Multiple outcomes (e.g., 0-1 goals: 3.0, 2-3 goals: 2.5).
    - **Integration:** Method `calculate_goal_range(range_odds_dict, stake)` to hedge across ranges.

**Integration into Heage Betting App:**
- **Modify API Fetching:** Update `betfair_api.py` and `smarkets_api.py` to fetch additional market types (e.g., `OVER_UNDER_25`, `CORRECT_SCORE`, `BOTH_TEAMS_TO_SCORE`) by adjusting filters in `list_live_markets`.
- **New Methods in `StrategyCalculators`:** Add methods for each bet type, following the arbitrage model:
  - Calculate lay stakes and profits for each outcome.
  - Hedge across outcomes to find guaranteed profit or minimize loss.
  - Return profit scenarios and profitability status.
- **Data Structure:** Use dictionaries for multi-outcome bets (e.g., correct score, HT/FT) to pass odds for each outcome.
- **Logging:** Extend logging to include new methods, following the existing format.
- **Endpoints in `enhanced_backend.py`:** Add endpoints for each bet type (e.g., `/api/strategies/over-under`, `/api/strategies/correct-score`).

### Your Role
- **Immediate Tasks:**
  1. **Task 4 (Part 2):** Update `enhanced_backend.py` with arbitrage and lay-the-draw endpoints using `Task_4_Claude_2_Instructions.txt` in `2_Task_Instructions/`.
     - Upload the instructions, `enhanced_backend.py` (from `3_Completed_Files/`), and `hedge_calculator.py` (from `4_Reference_Files/` for style) to Claude 2.
     - Save Claude 2’s output as `enhanced_backend_draft.py` in `6_Working_Drafts/`, verify, and move to `3_Completed_Files/`.
  2. **Expand `strategy_calculators.py`:** Use the research above to rewrite `strategy_calculators.py` to include all football bet types.
     - Instruct Claude to add new methods for each bet type, ensuring proper hedging calculations.
     - Update `betfair_api.py` and `smarkets_api.py` to fetch additional market types.
  3. **Task 5:** Proceed with rewriting `RecentOdds.jsx` for the frontend.
- **Workflow:**
  1. Provide instructions to Claude for each file (split tasks as needed).
  2. User uploads files and instructions to Claude from the management structure.
  3. Review Claude’s output, adjust as needed, and coordinate with ChatGPT for triple-checking.
